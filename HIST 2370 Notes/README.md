## Overall Thoughts
This class was absolutely amazing. I came into it with very little European History knowledge. I had learned some basics in AP World History my freshman year of high school but overall was coming in fairly blind. The way this class is organized is incredible. Not only did I learn a mind-boggling amount of raw history, but I also got a fair dose of knowledge on historiography, methodology, and theoretical approaches to history relevant to early-modern Europe. If you're a Northeastern student with the opportunity to take any history course, I highly, **highly** recommend this one, and if this one isn't running, take one of Professor Cross's others.
